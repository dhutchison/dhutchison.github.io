Along with updating to use the latest version of the Twitter Ruby Gem, which now requires authentication, I've merged the "Twitter Favourites to The Hit List" and "Twitter Favourites to Reminders" into a single script. This model is more manageable in the future and allows additional applications to be added as configuration options.

Twitter Favourites to List now requires some extra configuration options, one of which determines which application the TODO item will be created in. This script, and the required documentation is now on GitHub here : <a href="https://github.com/dhutchison/DWI/tree/master/TwitterFavouritesToList">Twitter Favourites to List</a>. The two previous versions of this script have been removed.

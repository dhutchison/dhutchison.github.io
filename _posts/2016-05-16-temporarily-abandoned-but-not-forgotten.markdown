It has been around 6 months since I last posted a new article on this site. 

For the last 6 months I have been in full blown tight deadline project mode, which has resulted in a general lack of ability to pursue personal projects at night time. The one personal project which has seen some updates is the [Pythonista Dropbox Sync][1] script. 

As this first phase of the project I have been working on is drawing to a close, personal projects and research should be returning. The first item on the list however, will be writing up the Pythonista Dropbox Sync script, as it's current feature set is described by a set of GitHub issue tickets and nothing else.

The new advanced options screen, accessible with the `ctrl-shift-x` key sequence, includes some common options for setting the hostname, WiFi credentials, user authentication details and enabling SSH at the point of imaging a storage device.  

While this currently only works for Pi OS, it is a great step forward for headless setup. 

The full details are in the [Raspberry Pi announcement blog post][link_post].

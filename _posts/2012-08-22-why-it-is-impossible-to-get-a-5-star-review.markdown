On a related note to [today's xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/1098/) it is not possible to have multiple reviews, and still have a 5 star rating. 

This comment on Amazon says it all:

The product it was for was [this set of stylii][stylii]. At less than Â£3 for them with free delivery they surely must be worth a gamble!

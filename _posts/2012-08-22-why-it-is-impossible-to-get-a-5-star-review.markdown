On a related note to [today's xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/1098/) it is not possible to have multiple reviews, and still have a 5 star rating. 

This comment on Amazon says it all:

</a>

The product it was for was [this set of stylii](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007LNE6GI). At less than Â£3 for them with free delivery they surely must be worth a gamble!

This is just a quick post to announce that a new version of the `generate_service.sh` script is now available. 

Instead of putting the source for this into this post, I've now committed it to a Github repository here: [generate_service.sh][generate_service.sh]. This version adds support for generating additional service files for accessories defined under a platform in Homebridge. 

I have been testing this out with a Samsung Tizen based TV, but this has exposed another issue with Wake-on-Lan packets not being able to be routed from a Docker network without using host mode. I'm still investigating options to solve this, which will be another post (or defeat, time will tell).

This site was originally built as part of a self re-education in the world of basic web development. While the site has been built from scratch, over time it has been inspired and helped by many great open source projects and utilities. 

### [Jekyll][jekyll]

> Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby

Jekyll is the underlying engine that generates the static HTML that drives this site. No database or dynamic language support is required to host this site. All pages are static HTML produced with a mixture of template and markdown files.

### [GitHub Pages][github pages]
GitHub offer free hosting for sites that are either static or powered by Jekyll. On Jekyll powered sites a commit to the correct branch is all that is required to redeploy the site with updated changes. They also support custom domain names. 

### [IcoMoon - Icon Font & SVG Icon Sets][icomoon]
The icons used in various parts of this site use a font instead of images. 
### [Jekyll-sitemap Plugin][sitemap]
The [sitemap][site_sitemap] for this site is now produced by this plugin, thanks to Github pages [now supporting][sitemap_ghpages] it. 

### [Stack Overflow Design][stacks_font]

Stack Overflow made a change in mid 2021 to use a selection of system fonts, targeted to specific platforms, instead of custom fonts. 

To aid loading time, and remove some dependencies on third-party resources, I am following the same approach. 

### Affiliates
Affiliate links are used where applicable when referring to products. This in no way affects the content of this site. I do not have that nasty marketing gene.

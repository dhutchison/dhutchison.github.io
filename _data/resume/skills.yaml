    Through my time doing professional, academic, and hobbyist software development I have worked with a wide selection of software technologies. I enjoy learning new technologies as required to meet requirements and try to keep up to date with both new technology and industry developments.
        
    In addition to the technologies I have listed above as part of my day to day work, I also have past experience using: JAX-WS, JAX-B, Java EE 5/6, Glassfish, JBoss, ApacheDS, Axis 1.4 (with WSS4J), PHP, HTML, CSS (with LESS), Jekyll, Ruby and Python.
